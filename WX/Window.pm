# add-in base class for windows that are added to My::Notbooks
#
# It's easy to create a new window that corresponds to a command.
# Just add the id's to the resources in the range for window-commands
# and use the window, and create it in the application frame
# onCreatePane() method.
#
# Similarly, it's easy to create a window that is associated
# with some user data (i.e. client_num or filename).  Just
# provide a getConfigStr() method that returns the data
# associated with the window, and call the constructor
# with the config_str.
#
# Multiple instance windows are trickier.
# The pm file for the window should have a static instance_number.
# The first instance number should be 1.
# Pass that instance number into the Pub::WX::Window::become() method.
#
#    The window ID passed in is the 'base' ID of the window
#    so you should be sure to reserve a range in mbeResources.pm
#
#    There must be an explicit command event handler in mbeManager.pm
#    and mbeManagerMisc.pm to instantiate a new one. It is no longer
#    a simple ranged window command.
#
#    The data element must be set to the instance data as well.
